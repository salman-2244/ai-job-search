# CV Templates and Tailoring Guide

<!-- BEGIN ACTIVE-TEMPLATE (managed by /add-template - do not edit by hand) -->
> **Active template override: `onepage-ats`**
>
> A custom template is active. Where this block conflicts with the stock guidance below, this block wins. Structural advice below (tailoring, page-budget, cutting rules) still applies.
>
> - **Template skeleton:** `templates/cv/onepage-ats/template.tex` — use this as the structural reference instead of the stock moderncv template
> - **Manifest:** `templates/cv/onepage-ats/TEMPLATE.md` — read this for style rules and known pitfalls before drafting
> - **Source extension:** `.tex`
> - **Compile command:** `lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode Salman-Resume.tex` (this is already the stock CV engine, so nothing changes on that front; the *layout* is the one-page single-column resume, not moderncv)
> - **Fonts:** Lato via the `lato` LaTeX package (system/distribution font — must be installed with the TeX distribution; no bundled font files, no font-path juggling, so nothing needs copying into `cv/`)
> - **Page limit:** exactly **1 page** (this overrides the stock "exactly 2 pages" rule everywhere below and in the CLAUDE.md checklist)
> - **Output file:** the automated pipeline writes `cv/<company>_<role>/Salman-Resume.tex`, so the PDF a recruiter opens is `Salman-Resume.pdf` — never `main.tex`/`main.pdf`. (Manual `/apply` runs still use the flat `cv/main_<company>_<role>.tex` scheme, which already carries the company in the filename and cannot collapse to one shared name inside `cv/`.) All packages it uses are standard, so no class/package/font files need copying into the output directory.
> - **Contact line:** exactly one line — email, phone, location, LinkedIn handle, then a Portfolio link (`https://salman.wuaze.com/?i=1`, label "Portfolio") — with items separated by the template's `\contactsep`. No GitHub item. Do not restore the old two-line form; that reclaimed line belongs to experience and project content now.
> - **Keyword population:** pull the top 5–8 hard-skill keywords from the posting and weave them into the existing Experience and Projects bullets, replacing generic phrasing with the posting's own term where it truthfully describes the same work. No fake jobs or projects; at most one appended bullet per CV when a keyword fits nowhere, and only when the profile genuinely supports it.
> - **Real-data reference:** `cv/main_example_onepage.tex` is the filled master in this format (compiles to one page, ATS-clean); read it for a concrete example of the macros in use. `cv/main_example.tex` (moderncv) remains a **fact source only** — read it for facts, never for layout while this template is active.
> - **Fill rules:** replace the `[PLACEHOLDER]` tokens; keep the single column (never add a second column or sidebar — it breaks ATS reading order); print email/phone as literal text (never icon-only); use `--` for date ranges and never an em-dash; trim to one page with relevance-weighted cutting (drop the least posting-relevant bullets first), never by shrinking geometry or font. Do not include a separate AWARDS & CERTIFICATIONS section; certifications belong under EDUCATION via `\skillgroup{Certifications}{...}` as in the Sample CV (`cv/Sample CV/main.tex`).

<!-- SETUP: Profile statements and section ordering are personalized by running /setup -->

## Template: LaTeX moderncv (Banking Style)

All CVs use the moderncv LaTeX package with the "banking" style and "blue" color scheme.

**Output file:** `cv/main_<company>_<role>.tex`
**Compile with:** **lualatex** on MiKTeX/TeX Live. pdflatex often fails on modern MiKTeX installs with `fontawesome5` font-expansion errors; lualatex handles the same sources cleanly.
**Master reference:** `cv/main_example.tex` (comprehensive CV with all competencies, experience, and achievements - use as source when building targeted CVs)

### Compile command

```bash
cd cv && lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode main_<company>_<role>.tex
```

Expected output: `Output written on main_<company>_<role>.pdf (1 page, ...)`. Any page count other than 1 is a failure that must be fixed before presenting to the user.

## Document Structure

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,sans]{moderncv}
\moderncvstyle{banking}
\moderncvcolor{blue}

% Force both first and last name AND section headings to render in moderncv
% blue (color1). Default banking on lualatex+MiKTeX leaves these black, which
% looks inconsistent with the rest of the blue accent scheme.
\renewcommand*{\firstnamestyle}[1]{{\fontsize{34}{36}\bfseries\upshape\color{color1}#1}}
\renewcommand*{\lastnamestyle}[1]{{\fontsize{34}{36}\bfseries\upshape\color{color1}#1}}
\renewcommand*{\sectionstyle}[1]{{\sectionfont\color{color1}#1}}

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
    colorlinks=true,

\begin{document}
\makecvtitle

% 1. Profile statement (1-3 sentences, tailored per role)
% 2. Skills section
% 3. Education section
% 4. Professional Experience section
% 5. Selected Publications (if applicable)
% 6. References (on one-page CV, no separate references section; add "References available upon request" under Languages if needed)

\end{document}
```

### Color overrides

The three `\renewcommand*` lines in the preamble are required on lualatex+MiKTeX. Without them the firstname, lastname, and section headings render in black even though `\moderncvcolor{blue}` is set, which looks inconsistent with the rest of the blue accent scheme (links, bullet markers, contact icons). The override forces all three to use `color1` (moderncv's accent colour, which becomes blue under `\moderncvcolor{blue}`). Both names render bold; if you prefer the firstname in regular weight, change the firstnamestyle override from `\bfseries` to `\mdseries`. Don't drop the override - on most modern installs the defaults render visibly wrong.

### Spacing inside itemize lists (important)

**Do not place `\vspace{...}` between `\item` entries in an `itemize` list.** Even though the source looks symmetric, this pattern occasionally produces a noticeably oversized gap before a single item: the inter-item `\vspace` creates a paragraph break that interacts unpredictably with the list's internal `\itemsep`, so LaTeX renders one of the gaps wider than the rest. Remove the inter-item `\vspace` and let `itemize` use its native uniform spacing.

```latex
% WRONG - intermittently produces an oversized gap before one bullet
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Foo}: ...
\vspace{1pt}
\item \textbf{Bar}: ...
\vspace{1pt}
\item \textbf{Baz}: ...
\end{itemize}

% RIGHT - uniform spacing using the list's native itemsep
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Foo}: ...
\item \textbf{Bar}: ...
\item \textbf{Baz}: ...
\end{itemize}
```

Two related patterns are fine and should be kept:
- `\vspace{1pt}` immediately after `\section{...}` (between section heading and first item) - this is between the heading and the list, not between list items.
- `\vspace{3pt}` between top-level `\cventry` blocks in Professional Experience or Education - this gives breathing room between roles and renders consistently.

### Section headings must match the CV's language (important)

Section headings such as `\section{Core Competencies}`, `Professional Experience`, `Education`, `Languages`, `Publications`, `References` (and any others your template defines), plus the `Available upon request.` line under References, are all **literal English text baked into the template** - they do not translate themselves. Whenever the CV language (see `CV language` in the candidate profile) is not English, translate every one of these too, whatever they are, not just the body prose - a CV with a fully localized profile statement and bullets sitting under untouched English section headers reads as sloppy and inconsistent, and it's an easy thing to forget precisely because the prose translation is the obvious, visible part of the job. Worked example for Spanish: `Competencias Clave`, `Experiencia Profesional`, `Educaci\'on`, `Idiomas`, `Publicaciones`, `Referencias`, `Disponibles a solicitud.` The same rule applies for any other target language - check this explicitly during the verification pass. Note: the active `onepage-ats` template uses `\cvsection{...}` headings instead of `\section{...}` — those must also be translated consistently.

## Section-by-Section Tailoring

### Profile Statement / Elevator Pitch (Best Practice)
This is the most important section to customize. It appears right after `\makecvtitle`.

Write 5-7 lines that function as an "elevator pitch": a concise, compelling introduction explaining why you're qualified for *this specific role*. Focus on what the employer gains from hiring you.

When the role sits outside your home domain, **lead with the domain-transfer argument** - the one or two sentences connecting your background to their problem (e.g. wave physics to radar signal processing) belong in the profile statement's opening, not buried in the cover letter. It is the strongest card a domain-changer holds; play it first.

**Create 2-3 profile statement templates for your main role types:**

<!-- Populated by /setup. These are phrasing starting points; every factual claim still comes
from 01-candidate-profile.md, and each statement is tailored per posting before use. -->

**For AI / ML Engineering roles:**
> Computer scientist and AI/ML practitioner who turns models into business impact. At Nokia, built an Azure Document Intelligence pipeline that cut manual processing effort by ~35%, fine-tuned LLMs for internal ERP-integrated use cases, and shipped ML/GenAI initiatives across supply chain and network solutions. Strong in Python (pandas, Keras), SQL, and Azure ML, with a track record of taking AI use cases from PoC to production.

**For Data Science / Data Analytics / Business Intelligence roles:**
> Data scientist and analyst with a Computer Science degree from ELTE Budapest and hands-on experience across supply chain, procurement, finance, and telecom analytics. Combines Python/SQL modeling with Power BI/DAX dashboarding to turn messy operational data into decisions, from inventory analytics across Nokia's CNS markets to ~20% procurement cost efficiency at Wizz Air.

**For AI Product Management / AI Strategy / AI Automation roles:**
> AI-focused professional who sits at the intersection of technical depth and business strategy. Led an AI squad at Nokia developing generative-AI use cases, aligning product owners, data engineering, and operations, and automated end-to-end workflows (Selenium, Power Automate, Power BI) that removed manual handoffs. Builds the right AI solutions, grounded in business context and designed to scale.

**For Supply Chain / Operations Analytics roles:**
> Analytics professional pairing supply-chain and operations domain knowledge with modern data and AI skills. Ran tender management in SAP Ariba and deep-dive inventory analytics (WIP, DOP, LSMGIT, CSMGIT), delivered ~20% procurement cost efficiency, and now leads AI/ML initiatives that make operations measurably smarter with Python, Power BI, and Azure ML.

Statements labeled *[Used for: <company>_<role>]* were extracted from archived application drafts by `/setup` Path A. They are **phrasing references, never fact sources**: when drafting from one, every factual claim still comes from `01-candidate-profile.md` - a past tailored draft does not vouch for its own accuracy.

### Core Competencies / Skills Section (Best Practice)
Reorder and emphasize based on the role. Use bold category labels.

List **5-7 key competencies** in bullet format, tailored to the specific job. For each competency, briefly explain how it adds value to the position.

Use the posting's own core term in the matching bullet's bold label when it truthfully applies - ATS and skim-reading hiring managers match literally, and "MLOps" in a heading outperforms a paraphrase like "ML Deployment".

#### Bold Density Rule (important)
When writing experience and project bullets, aim for **approximately one `\textbf{}` call per bullet** — not zero, not three. Skill-group labels (the category names before the pipe-separated list) are always bold and exempt from this rule. The rationale: a bullet with no bold keyword is invisible to both skimming readers and ATS scanners; a bullet with three bold phrases looks like noise and dilutes emphasis. One well-placed bold token per bullet gives maximum signal for minimum visual cost.

### Education
- Always include your highest degrees
- For senior roles, keep education brief (dates and titles only)
- Include thesis topics when relevant to the target role

#### In-progress qualifications must say so explicitly

**A bare year range is not enough.** An entry reading `2025–2026`, seen partway through 2026, looks like a *finished* degree, because a reader skimming a CV treats a closed range as closed. A profile statement that says "currently completing…" does not fix it: the education entry is where a reader checks the credential, so it has to stand on its own.

State completion inside the entry itself:

```latex
\item{\cventry{2025--2026}{[Degree], [Field]}{[Institution]}{[Location]}{}{\vspace{1pt}
In progress, expected [Month Year]. [Relevant topics]
}}
```

Any consistent form works: `In progress, expected <Month Year>.` / `Expected completion <Month Year>.` / a date field of `2025–present`.

Claiming a credential not yet held is a factual misstatement, and it is the kind discovered at transcript or reference check rather than at interview. It costs nothing to prevent. The same applies to in-progress certifications and courses.

**Check for agreement:** for a current student, the profile statement, the education entry, and any availability or work-permit note must all give the same completion date. Contradiction between them is worse than any single version.

### Professional Experience
- Rewrite bullet points to emphasize aspects most relevant to the target role
- Use 4-6 bullets for most recent role, 3-4 for previous, 2-3 for older
- **Emphasize measurable results** where possible: "Reduced processing time by X%", "Model adopted by the team"

#### Check tenure against visible output

Before finalizing, look at each role the way a stranger will: **date span versus how much work is shown.** A two-year role represented by a single project reads as low output, whether or not that is fair. The reader cannot know what filled the time, so they guess, and the guess is unflattering.

This bites hardest on **career changers** (part of the tenure went into learning the new field), on **long-cycle work** (industrial deployment, clinical or regulatory projects, research — one delivery genuinely takes quarters), and on anyone whose employer kept them on a single account or product.

Three honest fixes, in order of preference:

1. **Surface more real work.** Ask what else the period contained. There are often real secondary projects, internal tooling, or support work that never reached the CV because it felt minor. Best fix when the material exists.
2. **Make the phases within the role explicit.** If the span genuinely had stages, say so — an initial period learning the domain or supporting the team, then ownership of the named work through to delivery. A phased arc reads as a growth curve; an undifferentiated multi-year block reads as stagnation.
3. **Name what made the cycle long.** Data collection from a live environment, validation with domain experts, deployment and iteration against real output. Reviewers who know the domain accept this immediately.

**Never** pad with invented projects, and **never** quietly shorten the employment dates so the ratio looks better. Both are discoverable, and both are worse than the perception problem being solved.

**Prepare the interview answer too.** If a long span against little visible output survives these fixes, the question is coming. The candidate needs a ready two-part answer — what actually filled the time, and what the outcome was — recorded in their interview prep rather than improvised in the room.

### Handling Employment Gaps (Best Practice)
If there is a gap in your employment history:
- The gap should be explained matter-of-factly if needed
- Describe how professional development continued during the gap
- Frame as deliberate skill-building and career repositioning

### Publications
- Include Google Scholar link if applicable
- Select 3-4 most relevant publications (not always all of them)
- For non-academic roles, keep brief

### Evidence Links
Wherever the CV names a verifiable artifact - a public project, a hackathon entry, a publication - carry its link (`\href`) so a reader can verify the claim in one click. A CV whose strongest claims are checkable reads as more credible everywhere else too.

**Note:** the active `onepage-ats` template does not include a separate Honors and Awards section. Certifications are embedded under EDUCATION via `\skillgroup{Certifications}{...}` (see `cv/Sample CV/main.tex`). If a posting specifically asks for awards, mention them inline within the most relevant experience bullet rather than adding a dedicated section.

### References
- List 2-4 references with name, title, company, and contact
- End with: "More references are available upon request."
- **Do not attach reference letters** - employers typically contact references directly

## Compile-and-Inspect Loop (MANDATORY)

After writing the CV and before presenting to the user, always compile and visually inspect the PDF. Iterate until the layout is clean. Workflow:

1. Run `lualatex -interaction=nonstopmode main_<company>_<role>.tex`
2. Check the output page count: must be exactly **1**
3. Read the PDF via the Read tool and visually inspect the single page
4. Check for **orphaned entries**: a `\cventry` title line must never sit at the bottom of the page with its bullets spilling onto a second page

### Fixing common page-break problems

**Problem: entry title at the bottom of the page, bullets below the margin**
Add `\needspace{5\baselineskip}` immediately before the problematic `\cventry`:
```latex
\needspace{5\baselineskip}
\item{\cventry{YEAR-YEAR}{Role Title}{Organization}{Location}{}{...}}
```
Include `\usepackage{needspace}` in the preamble.

**Caveat - use `\needspace` before entries, never before `\cvsection` headings.** A section-level `\needspace` pushes the entire section (heading plus content) to the next page whenever the request does not fit, stranding empty space above and typically *adding* a page instead of saving one. Apply it only to the individual `\cventry` that actually orphans, and only after a compile shows the orphan.

**Problem: one trailing section spills past the bottom margin (e.g., Languages alone pushes onto a second page)**
Add `\enlargethispage{2-3\baselineskip}` before a late section (e.g., before `\cvsection{\faLanguage}{LANGUAGES}`) to stretch the first page by a few lines. This is the standard LaTeX rescue for near-miss overflows.

**Problem: content finishes early (feels thin)**
Restore the highest-relevance item that was previously cut — a CV that ends mid-page looks incomplete.

## ATS Parseability

Most employers run CVs through an ATS before a human sees them, and the ATS reads the PDF's embedded **text layer**, not the rendered page. A CV can pass visual inspection and still extract as garbage. After the layout passes the compile-and-inspect loop, verify the text layer:

```bash
cd cv && pdftotext -layout main_<company>_<role>.pdf main_<company>_<role>.txt
```

`pdftotext` comes from [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/), not the TeX distribution - it is an **optional** dependency. If it is not installed, skip the mechanical check with a warning and rely on the visual PDF read for keyword coverage.

What to check in the extraction:

- **Contact details as literal text.** The stock template's fontawesome contact icons extract as glyph names (`MOBILE-ALT`, `Envelope`) - harmless noise, because the actual address and number are printed beside them. The failure mode is a contact detail carried *only* by an icon or a hyperlink (like the `LinkedIn` link text, whose URL is not in the text layer): invisible to an ATS. The email address must always appear as printed text.
- **No garbled output.** `(cid:NNN)` markers or `�` characters mean a font is embedded without a Unicode mapping - an ATS sees the same garbage. This shows up with unusual fonts in custom templates, not with the stock moderncv setup under lualatex.
- **Reading order.** The stock banking style is single-column, so extraction order matches visual order. Custom templates (via `/add-template`) with sidebars or multi-column layouts can interleave unrelated lines; if extraction order is scrambled, the user is trading ATS compatibility for looks and should be told.
- **Keyword coverage.** Match the posting's required/preferred terms against the extracted text, in the posting's language. Prefer the posting's exact term over a synonym when it is truthfully applicable - ATS matching is often literal. Never add a keyword the profile does not support.

### Date fields must be ASCII ranges (confirmed ATS import failure)

This one is worth knowing about because it fails **silently**. A CV that passes every other check in this section - clean extraction, no `(cid:)` markers, contact details intact, correct reading order - can still have its dates dropped on import. In a real Workday resume import, a CV built from this template lost the end date of a short contract role and failed to import **any** education entry at all, forcing manual re-entry. Nothing about the PDF or its text layer looked wrong.

Two independent causes, both easy to avoid:

1. **`--` in a `\cventry` date renders as an en-dash (U+2013), not a hyphen.** LaTeX ligatures `--` (two ASCII hyphens, U+002D) into a single en-dash glyph, so `2016--2024` reaches the PDF text layer as `2016<U+2013>2024`. Many parsers split date ranges only on an ASCII hyphen and see no range at all. Write the date argument with a **single hyphen**:

   ```latex
   \item{\cventry{2016-2024}{Role Title}{Organization}{Location}{}{...}}   % parses
   \item{\cventry{2016--2024}{Role Title}{Organization}{Location}{}{...}}  % en-dash, may not
   ```

   This applies to the **date argument only**. Keep `--` everywhere it is typographically correct in prose, for example a numeric range like `EUR 600k--1M`.

2. **A bare single year gives the parser no end date.** A short contract, mandate or internship written as `\cventry{2016}` imports as a start date with nothing to close it. Use an explicit range, with months where the role ran under a year:

   ```latex
   \item{\cventry{Mar 2016 - Jul 2016}{Contract Role}{Client}{Location}{}{...}}
   ```

   Where a genuine range exists, use it even when a single year would be factually accurate - a degree written `1995` is true but imports worse than `1992-1995`. Do not invent a start date you do not have; a lone graduation year is fine, just expect it to be typed in by hand.

**Add this to the step 5d checks**: after extracting the text layer, confirm every experience entry shows a start *and* an end separated by an ASCII hyphen. Because the failure is silent and invisible in the PDF, the candidate otherwise discovers it only while filling in the application form.

## Page Budget - Hard 2-Page Limit

The CV **must** fit on exactly 1 page when compiled. Use these content limits as a guide:

| Section | Max budget |
|---------|-----------|
| Profile statement | 3-4 lines |
| Skills | 5 items, each 1-2 lines |
| Most recent role | 4-5 bullets |
| Previous role | 2-3 bullets |
| Older roles | 2 bullets (1 line each) |
| Education | 2-3 entries |
| Publications | 2-3 entries |
| References | "Available upon request." (single line) |

**If in doubt, cut rather than squeeze.** Reducing `\vspace` or geometry scale to force-fit content makes the CV look cramped.

## Relevance-weighted cutting (the right way to shrink a CV)

**Cut by signal, not by section.** Static priority lists ("remove oldest education first, then shorten the earliest role...") are wrong when a relevant "lower-priority" item is competing with an irrelevant "higher-priority" item. An older-role bullet that speaks directly to the posting is worth more than a recent-role bullet that does not.

For every candidate line, score three things:

1. **Relevance to THIS posting** — does the line hit a named tool, keyword, or stated responsibility in the job ad?
2. **Uniqueness** — is it the only place this claim appears, or is it duplicated elsewhere in the CV?
3. **Narrative load** — does the cover letter depend on it? If cutting the line would force you to rewrite a cover-letter paragraph, it is load-bearing.

Cut the lowest-total-score line first, regardless of which section it sits in.

### Practical order of cuts (easiest → last resort)

1. **Redundancy.** If an achievement appears in both Core Competencies AND a role bullet, the Core Competencies version is usually the cleaner cut (the experience bullet is more concrete evidence).
2. **Profile-statement fluff.** A sentence that just restates what Publications or Skills will show. ("Peer-reviewed publications on X..." is already a Publications entry — profile can claim it once and stop.)
3. **Low-relevance experience bullets.** A bullet about work that does not touch posting keywords, wherever it sits. This cuts across sections before touching the structural list.
4. **Low-relevance supporting content.** An older-role bullet that does not speak to the target role. A certification that does not touch the posting's stack. A language entry that can be condensed to one line.
5. **Low-relevance publications.** Keep 1-2 publications that best match the posting. Cut the rest before touching experience bullets.
6. **Last-resort structural cuts.** Oldest education entry, tightening an older role to 2 bullets, collapsing Certifications into a single line. These only happen if the relevance-weighted cuts above have already been exhausted.

### Pitfalls to avoid

- Do not mechanically cut from the bottom of a static section list without checking relevance. "Cut the oldest role first" is wrong if that role is literally about the skill the posting asks for.
- Do not cut the one concrete example the cover letter leans on. Relevance is measured against the cover letter you wrote, not just the job posting — interviewers will have read both.
- Do not cut to fit if the fit is borderline (1.02 pages). Prefer `\enlargethispage{2-3\baselineskip}` on a late section for near-misses; reserve content cuts for genuine overflow (content past the bottom margin that is more than a single trailing section).

## Recommended Section Order

The section order varies by role type:

**For technical / data science / ML roles:**
1. Profile statement / elevator pitch
2. Core competencies / Skills
3. Professional Experience (reverse chronological)
4. Education (reverse chronological)
5. Languages
6. References (only if space permits; otherwise omit and state "Available upon request" inline)

**For domain-specific / specialist roles:**
1. Profile statement / elevator pitch
2. Core competencies / Skills
3. Education (reverse chronological) - credentials are a key qualifier
4. Professional Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Languages
6. References (only if space permits)
